# gists

A collection of my more popular and useful GitHub gists.

## Why? 

I've got a bunch of gists and some of them somehow started to get noticed.
People would comment on them, but because they're on a separate platform, I
do not get notifications and support becomes difficult.

- Got a question? [Open an issue] in this repo
