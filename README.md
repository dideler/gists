# gists

A collection of some of [my GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/dideler?direction=desc&sort=updated).

## Why?

I've got a bunch of gists. This list makes the good ones more discoverable.  
It also improves support as I otherwise don't get notified of activity on gists.

## How?

- Got an improvement to suggest for a specific gist? [Open an issue] in this repo
- Got a question about a specific gist? [Open an issue] in this repo
- Got a statement to make or just want to say thanks? Leave a comment on the relevant gist

**Support is not guaranteed**, this is volunteer work.

**Deprecated** gists are no longer supported. Their content may be outdated.

All gists are distributed under the MIT license.
