# gists

A collection of some of [my GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/dideler?direction=desc&sort=updated).

## Why? 

I've got a bunch of gists. Some of them get noticed.
People comment on them, but because they're on a separate platform, I
do not receive notifications and support becomes difficult.
This repo aims to make supporting them easier.

- Got a statement to make or just want to say thanks? Leave a comment on the relevant gist
- Got an improvement to suggest for a specific gist? [Open an issue] in this repo
- Got a question about a specific gist? [Open an issue] in this repo

**Deprecated** gists are no longer supported.
